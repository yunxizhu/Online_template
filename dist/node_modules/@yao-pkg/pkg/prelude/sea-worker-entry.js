// threads. In classic (non-SEA) pkg the worker bootstrap runs the same code
// path as the main thread and sets this up; without it, libraries that gate
// packaged-vs-filesystem logic on `process.pkg` misbehave in workers (e.g.,
// a pino transport that resolves paths through such a check writes into the
// read-only snapshot and hangs waiting for `open`).
